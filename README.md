# Data Science for Business, MSc Course @ University of Insubria

This repository contains my project work for the Data Science for Business course at the University of Insubria, part of the MSc in Computer Science.

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered Python application for weather nowcasting in the Lake Como area. It combines data from a network of physical sensor stations, which collect environmental measurements every five minutes, with a machine learning model trained on these observations to generate short-term forecasts (30–120 minutes ahead). By leveraging high-frequency, real-time sensor data, the system aims to provide accurate hyperlocal predictions of rapidly evolving weather conditions.

## Instructions

Usage:

```sh
bash cmd.sh {setup|collector|deploy_jobs}
```

### `setup`

If you haven't built the project yet, you can do so by running:

```sh
bash cmd.sh setup
```

### `collector`

To collect data, you can run the following command:
